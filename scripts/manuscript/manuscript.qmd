# Introduction

Biodiversity is the summation of variation in biological life, across
genes, species, communities, and ecosystems. Currently, biodiversity is
in decline, facing extinction rates above the background extinction rate
[@thomas2004; @urban2015], and homogenization of communities at various
scales [@mcgill2015]. In response, the global biodiversity community is
making efforts to assess and halt the degradation of biodiversity on
earth. The Group for Earth Observation Biodiversity Observation Network
has developed the Essential Biodiversity Variables [EBVs, @pereira2013],
designed as an analog to the Essential Climate Variables framework
[@bojinski2014]. EBVs are designed to be global in scope, relevant to
biodiversity information, feasible to utilize, and complementary to one
another [@skidmore2021].

There are six EBV classes, each corresponding to a different facet of
biodiversity, including, genetic composition, species populations,
species traits, community composition, ecosystem structure, and
ecosystem function [@pereira2013]. @fern√°ndez2020 divides the six
classes into two approaches, with one focusing on species biodiversity,
and the other focusing on ecosystem diversity. Remote sensing has proven
to be capable of measure five of the six classes, with the exception
being genetic composition, which requires in-situ observation and
samples [@skidmore2021]. Notably, while remote sensing can provide
information on the remaining two species EBV classes, this information
is typically acquired with an *ad-hoc* approach requiring high spatial
and spectral resolution data. This data can often only be collected at
local extents, rather than the global or regional scales required for
biodiversity trend assessment [@valdez2023]. Community composition falls
into a similar dilemma, requiring species population information which
necessitates high resolution spatial data.

The remaining two classes, ecosystem structure and function, are
incredibly well suited to be examined at global or regional scales using
mid-resolution satellite imagery, such as that provided by the Landsat
series of satellites. Advances in satellite remote sensing processing
have allowed 3d forest structure data to be imputed across wide spatial
scales [@matasci2018; @coops2021] using data fusion approaches involving
collected lidar data and optical/radar data. Other advances in image
compositing have allowed yearly summaries of vegetation productivity to
be calculated at regional to global scales, summarizing the yearly
energy totals, minimums, and variations [@radeloff2019]. These datasets
correspond quite well with the EBV classes ecosystem structure (forest
structural diversity metrics), and ecosystem function (forest
productivity metrics).

Forest structural diversity has been linked to biodiversity at various
scales [@guo2017; @bergen2009; @gao2014]. Increased structural
complexity is hypothesized to create additional niches, leading to
increased species diversity [@bergen2009]. The relationship between
forest structure and biodiversity is commonly assessed using avian
species diversity metrics [@macarthur1961; @goetz2007], however, other
clades (and habitats), have also been used [@davies2014; @nelson2005].
Many metrics derived from lidar remote sensing have been used as local
indicators of biodiversity, including canopy cover, canopy height,
vertical profiles, and aboveground biomass, while other 2nd order
derived metrics such as canopy texture, height class distribution,
edges, and patch metrics have been used to examine habitat and
biodiversity at landscape scales [@bergen2009].

The dynamic habitat indices (DHIs) are indicators of productivity
calculated by summarizing vegetation indices over the course of one (or
multiple) years [@radeloff2019]. These indices have been related to
multiple facets of biodiversity at a range of scales, including species
occurrence and abundance [@razenkova2020], alpha [@radeloff2019] and
beta diversity [@andrew2012]. Hypotheses behind the biodiversity
productivity relationships have been established, including the
species-energy hypothesis, the environmental stress hypothesis, and the
environmental stability hypothesis [@coops2019]. The cumulative DHI
calculates the total amount of energy available in a given pixel over
the course of a year. Cumulative DHI is strongly linked to the available
energy hypothesis, which suggests that with greater available energy
species richness will increase [@wright1983]. The minimum DHI, which
calculates the lowest productivity over the course of a year can be
matched to the environmental stress hypothesis, which proposes that
higher levels of minimum available energy will lead to higher species
richness [@currie2004]. Finally, the variation DHI, which calculates the
coefficient of variance in a vegetation index through the course of a
year, corresponds to the environmental stability hypothesis which states
that lower energy variation throughout a year will lead to increased
species richness [@williams2008].

Some vegetation structure metrics are simpler, and more accurate, to
calculate than others [@coops2021]. These basic metrics, such as canopy
height and canopy cover, can then be used to estimate additional
structure metrics, such as basal area or total biomass. Canopy height
and cover are commonly used as indicators of vertical and horizontal
variation, respectively. Recently, more attention has been paid to
internal structural complexity metrics, which can be more difficult and
time consuming to generate [@coops2021; @ma2022], but have been shown to
have stronger linkages with biodiversity [@guo2017], and productivity
[@ali2019].

Linkages between forest structure and productivity (namely, vegetation
indices) have been examined for nearly 20 years [@huete2002,
@knyazikhin1998; @myneni1994]. While there is significant theoretical
and empirical evidence for their relationship at single time points
(within a single image) [@myneni1994], various relationship directions
and shapes have been found between forest structure and productivity
metrics [@ali2019]. These relationships, their shapes, and their
strengths have been attributed to multiple possible hypotheses and have
been shown to vary based on environmental conditions [@ali2019]. The
relationship between forest structural diversity metrics and annual
productivity summaries has yet to be fully examined, including the DHIs.

Understanding the complementarity between potential EBVs is an integral
component of their creation [@skidmore2021]. Biodiversity has been shown
to be linked to both forest structure [@guo2017; @gao2014], and
productivity [@radeloff2019] at a range of scales. Research has
highlighted that the relationship between productivity and biodiversity
is reciprocal [@worm2003], making productivity a suitable biodiversity
indicator. In forested ecosystems, stand structural attributes have also
been shown to influence productivity, with a range of responses
dependent on environmental conditions [@ali2019].

Structural equation modelling and path analyses have been commonly used
in ecology to assess the causal effects behind various hypotheses
[@fan2016; @grace2010], including the relationship between forest
structure, functioning, and biodiversity [@ali2019] . In this paper we
seek to untangle the relationship between two EBVs: forest structure
diversity metrics and yearly summaries of forest productivity. To
accomplish this, we assess this relationship using path analysis to
assess the direct and indirect (as mediated by more complex forest
structural diversity metrics) effects of commonly collected forest
structural metrics (canopy height and canopy cover) on yearly
productivity summaries. Further, we use exploratory structural equation
modelling (ESEM) to identify the latent variables driving the
productivity metrics. We run this analysis both globally, and stratified
by the forested ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada, and compare
models using AIC scores and global fit measures across the ecosystems.
The results from this study will assess the linkages and complementarity
between two biodiversity indicators.

# Methods

## Study Area

British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, and is home to a
variety of terrestrial ecosystems [@pojar1987]. Approximately 64% of the
province is forested [@bcministryofforests2003]. There is a large amount
of ecosystem variation in the province, with large climate and
topographic gradients. The Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC)
system identifies 16 zones based on the dominant tree species and the
ecosystems general climate. These zones can be further split into
subzones, variants, and phases based on microclimate, precipitation, and
topography [@pojar1987].

## Data

### NTEMS

### Dynamic Habitat Indices

The Dynamic Habitat Indices are a set of satellite remote sensing
derived productivity variables that summarize the cumulative amount of
available energy, the minimum available energy, and the variation in
available energy throughout a given year [@radeloff2019]. The DHIs have
previously been produced at a global extent using MODIS imagery
[@radeloff2019], however, recent studies have examined how these indices
can be constructed at a finer spatial resolution using multi-annual
Landsat imagery.

## Sampling

We conducted model based sampling across the fifteen forest dominated
ecosystems found within British Columbia \[BC figure reference, I have
not made this figure yet\]. Samples were randomly selected within BEC
zones of interest alongside multiple criteria. Each sampled pixel had to
have a forested land cover class (coniferous, deciduous, mixed-wood, or
wetland-treed), and be surrounded by the same land cover class.
Additionally, each pixel had to have a coefficient of variation less
than 0.5 in the Lorey's height and canopy cover forest structural
metrics. These focal analyses were preprocessed in R and Python, and
randomly sampled across a masked suitability raster for each BEC zone
using the *sgsR* R package version 1.3.4 [@goodbody2023]. A maximum of
3000 samples were taken from each BEC zone.

\[note to ncc; I've stopped doing this sampling step as Meg said she
didn't feel it was necessary\]

The imputation method used to generate the forest structure layers leads
to many duplicated values as there are a limited number of samples to
predict from [@matasci2018]. A discussion of imputation approaches to
large area lidar attribute modelling can be found in @coops2021. To
account for duplicated input values in our modelling we averaged the
endogenous variables within each ecosystem for each uniquely imputed set
of forest attributes, forest type, and ecosystem. Due to variations in
ecosystem size, differing numbers of samples were generated for each
ecosystem. To account for this during model comparison, each ecosystem
and land cover sample set was downsampled to the minimum number of
samples for a single BEC zone (in this case, 170). For the forest type
models, we attempted to select equal numbers of observations from each
BEC zone. However, some forest types are rarely found in certain zones.
To account for this, if an equal number of samples from each BEC zone
were not available, the entire sample from that zone was taken. The
amount of samples taken from other zones was then increased in order to
collect a total number equal to the minimum number of samples in a
single BEC zones (170). To meet the normality assumptions of path
analysis, all variables were natural-log transformed and standardized,
as per @grace2016. Variables containing zeros were natural-log plus one
transformed.

## Analysis

### Path Analysis

To determine the relationships between simple lidar derived forest
structural attributes, complex/derived forest structural attributes, and
forest productivity, we used path analysis to analyze two causal models
(@fig-pathdag). To determine primary drivers of the three DHIs, we will
summarize the predictors across ecosystems by counting the strongest
predictor in each BEC zone. This will determine if the primary driver
for each facet of the DHI is simple or complex, and allow us to assess
ecosystem differences.

### Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling

Secondly, we will use exploratory structural equation modelling
[@marsh2020; @asparouhov2009] to identify latent forest structural
variables within the data, and use these latent variables to predict the
dynamic habitat indices. Exploratory structural equation modelling is a
combination of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation
modelling, which relaxes the strict requirement of zero cross-loadings
in confirmatory factor analysis and allows for less strict measurement
models to be used. ESEM is used when it is known that there is a latent
structure to the data, but the specific indicator variables have not yet
been determined.

One advantage of ESEM is that it can create varying numbers of latent
variables. For our analysis, we first ran exploratory factor analysis on
all forest structural attributes both globally and by BEC zone with
between 1-4 potential latent variables. We chose the most parsimonious
EFA model with the lowest AIC scores for each ecosystem, leading to
varying numbers of latent variables. We then determined the anchoring
indicator for each latent variable. The anchors were calculated by
choosing the indicator variable with the largest difference between the
maximum value in a given loading compared to to said indicators loadings
in all other latent variables. Each anchor variable was then assigned to
a named group (Canopy Cover, Height and Biomass, and Structural
Complexity).

Following the EFA, we used structural equation modelling, with latent
variables loadings determined by the EFA. We also filtered the loadings
to be greater than or equal to 0.5, allowing us to examine the number
and composition of latent variables found in each ecosystem. Following
this, we predicted the DHIs in a single SEM with covariances between the
DHIs. If a forest structural attribute did not end up in a latent
variable, it was included in the structural equation model as a DHI
predictor, without a latent variable as a mediator.

## Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling

I also want to run exploratory SEM with and without the DHI's to see
what grouping it goes in. MinDHI has been breaking because some zones
only have 0 as mindhi (makes sense, they are in the alpine).

```{r}
#| label: fig-esem-latent
#| fig-cap: Groups of latent variables with loadings greater than or equal to 0.5 for each BEC zone. Loadings were determined using exploratory factor analysis with up to four latent variables, and selecting the number of possible latent variables with the lowest AIC.

#| warning: false
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("outputs", "latent_groups.png"))
```

Exploratory factor analysis shows three groups of latent variables
(@fig-esem-latent). We assigned the groups to latent variables
indicating canopy cover / biomass metrics, canopy height / biomass
metrics, and structural complexity metrics. Indicators to latent
variable groups by examining anchors for each latent variable. The
anchors were calculated by choosing the indicator variable with the
largest difference between the maximum value in a given loading compared
to to said indicators loadings in all other latent variables.

Both the Ponderosa Pine (PP) and Sub-boreal Pine -- Spruce zones have
one latent variable. Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH), Engelmann Spurce --
Subalpine Fir (ESSF), and Montane Spruce (MS) are the only zones to have
structural complexity based latent variables. CWH is the only zone to
include elevation standard deviation in the structural complexity latent
variable.

```{r}
#| label: fig-esem-latent-dhi
#| fig-cap: Groups of latent variables with loadings greater than or equal to 0.5 for each BEC zone, including the DHIs.

```

Exploratory factor analysis shows three groups of latent variables. We
assigned these groups to attributes based on the indicator variables in
each latent variable, indicating canopy cover, height and biomass, and
structural complexity. When including the DHIs in this EFA, it is rare
that they are included with latent variables with large loadings. The
cumulative DHI is an indicator for the canopy cover latent varible in
the IDF (Interior Douglas-fir) and MS (Montane Spruce) BEC zones. The
DHIs are not included in any other latent variable, indicating that they
compose different information than the forest structural variables.

```

@fig-latent-boxplots shows boxplots of latent variable loadings from
forest structure indicator variables. A maximum of three valid latent
variables were identified across the sixteen BEC zones. We assigned
indicators variables to latent variable groups by examining the
anchoring variables for each latent variable. The anchoring variables
were calculated by choosing the indicator variable with the largest
difference between the maximum value in a given loading compared to said
indicators loadings in all other latent variables. The only DHI variable
that was included in the latent variables after subsetting the latent
variables to only include strong loadings was the Cumulative DHI in the
canopy cover latent variable.

I need to actually make the DAGs and plot the parameters, but I haven't
gotten there yet. I'll plot the global one to show what it looks like,
then aggregate it in some way - probably similar to the path analysis. I
also may include the variable partitioning that Meg talked about in the
email if I can get it working.
