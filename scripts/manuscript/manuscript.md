# Introduction

Biodiversity is the summation of variation in biological life, across
genes, species, communities, and ecosystems. Currently, biodiversity is
in decline, facing extinction rates above the background extinction rate
[@thomas2004; @urban2015], and homogenization of communities at various
scales [@mcgill2015]. In response, the global biodiversity community is
making efforts to assess and halt the degradation of biodiversity on
earth. The Group for Earth Observation Biodiversity Observation Network
has developed the Essential Biodiversity Variables [EBVs, @pereira2013],
designed as an analog to the Essential Climate Variables framework
[@bojinski2014]. EBVs are designed to be global in scope, relevant to
biodiversity information, feasible to utilize, and complementary to one
another [@skidmore2021].

There are six EBV classes, each corresponding to a different facet of
biodiversity, including, genetic composition, species populations,
species traits, community composition, ecosystem structure, and
ecosystem function [@pereira2013]. @fern√°ndez2020 divides the six
classes into two approaches, with one focusing on species biodiversity,
and the other focusing on ecosystem diversity. Remote sensing has proven
to be capable of measure five of the six classes, with the exception
being genetic composition, which requires in-situ observation and
samples [@skidmore2021]. Notably, while remote sensing can provide
information on the remaining two species EBV classes, this information
is typically acquired with an *ad-hoc* approach. This collects high
resolution, small spatial extent information, rather than the global or
regional scales required for biodiversity assessment. Community
composition falls into a similar dilemma, requiring species population
information which necessitates high resolution spatial data.

The remaining two classes, ecosystem structure and function, are
incredibly well suited to be examined at global or regional scales using
mid-resolution satellite imagery, such as that provided by the Landsat
series of satellites. Advances in satellite remote sensing processing
have allowed 3d forest structure data to be imputed across wide spatial
scales [@matasci2018; @coops2021] using data fusion approaches involving
collected lidar data and optical/radar data. Other advances in image
compositing have allowed yearly summaries of vegetation productivity to
be calculated at regional to global scales, summarizing the yearly
energy totals, minimums, and variations [@radeloff2019]. These datasets
correspond quite well with the EBV classes ecosystem structure (forest
structural diversity metrics), and ecosystem function (forest
productivity metrics).

Forest structural diversity has been linked to biodiversity at various
scales [@guo2017; @bergen2009; @gao2014]. Increased structural
complexity is hypothesized to create additional niches, leading to
increased species diversity [@bergen2009]. The relationship between
forest structure and biodiversity is commonly assessed using avian
species diversity metrics [@macarthur1961; @goetz2007], however, other
clades (and habitats), have been used [@davies2014; @nelson2005]. Many
metrics derived from lidar remote sensing have been used as local
indicators of biodiversity, including canopy cover, canopy height,
vertical profiles, and aboveground biomass, while other 2nd order
derived metrics such as canopy texture, height class distribution,
edges, and patch metrics have been used to examine habitat and
biodiversity at landscape scales [@bergen2009].

The dynamic habitat indices (DHIs) are indicators of productivity
calculated by summarizing vegetation indices over the course of one (or
multiple) years [@radeloff2019]. These indices have been related to
multiple facets of biodiversity at a range of scales, including species
occurrence and abundance [@razenkova2020], alpha [@radeloff2019] and
beta diversity [@andrew2012]. Hypotheses behind the biodiversity
productivity relationships have been established, including the
species-energy hypothesis, the environmental stress hypothesis, and the
environmental stability hypothesis [@coops2019]. The cumulative DHI
calculates the total amount of energy available in a given pixel over
the course of a year. Cumulative DHI is strongly linked to the available
energy hypothesis, which suggests that with greater available energy
species richness will increase [@wright1983]. The minimum DHI, which
calculates the lowest productivity over the course of a year can be
matched to the environmental stress hypothesis, which proposes that
higher levels of minimum available energy will lead to higher species
richness [@currie2004]. Finally, the variation DHI, which calculates the
coefficient of variance in a vegetation index through the course of a
year, corresponds to the environmental stability hypothesis which states
that lower energy variation throughout a year will lead to increased
species richness [@williams2008].

Linkages between forest structure and productivity (namely, vegetation
indices) have been examined for nearly 20 years [@huete2002,
@knyazikhin1998; @myneni1994]. While there is significant theoretical
and empirical evidence for their relationship at single time points
(within a single image) [@myneni1994], various relationship directions
and shapes have been found between forest structure and productivity
metrics [@ali2019]. These relationships, their shapes, and their
strengths have been attributed to multiple possible hypotheses and can
vary based on environmental conditions [@ali2019]. The relationship
between forest structural diversity metrics and annual productivity
summaries has yet to be fully examined, including the DHIs.

Some vegetation structure metrics are simpler, and more accurate, to
calculate than others [@coops2021]. These basic metrics, such as canopy
height and canopy cover,can then be used to estimate additional
structure metrics, such as basal area or total biomass. Canopy height
and cover are commonly used as an indicator of vertical and horizontal
variation, respectively. Recently, more attention has been paid to
internal structural complexity metrics, which can be more difficult and
time consuming to generate [@coops2021; @ma2022] .

In this study, we seek to untangle the relationship between two EBVs:
forest structure diversity metrics and yearly summaries of forest
productivity. To accomplish this, we assess this relationship using path
analysis to assess the direct and indirect (as mediated by more complex
forest structural diversity metrics) effects of commonly collected
forest structural metrics (canopy height and canopy cover) on yearly
productivity summaries. Doing so will in turn assess their utility as
complementary EBVs. We ran this analysis separately across four forested
land covers and the forested ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada.

# Methods

## Study Area

British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, and is home to a
variety of terrestrial ecosystems [@pojar1987]. Approximately 64% of the
province is forested [@bcministryofforests2003]. There is a large amount
of ecosystem variation in the province, with large climate and
topographic gradients. The Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC)
system identifies 16 zones based on the dominant tree species and the
ecosystems general climate. These zones can be further split into
subzones, variants, and phases based on microclimate, precipitation, and
topography.
